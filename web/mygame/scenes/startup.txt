You wake up from a weird dream, realizing that it is the last day before your final test. 

Some students are chatting outside about some exciting plans for their winter break. You can't wait to go home and meet your friends as well, but you still have this last test, and you don't want a bad score to ruin your mood. Survive this one last day, and then you can enjoy your long nice break.
*page_break
To make full use of your day, you need to balance between your time and energy. 

Usually the more energetic you are, the higher efficiency you will maintain. But keeping healthy usually means more time, and you could end up leaving a lot of pages unfinished, so you need to make some choices.
*goto food


*label food
*page_break
Though you wish to make use of every minute at hand reviewing your materials, you feel hungry at some point, and you have to spend some time eating. 

As for food, you can mainly choose between some fast food and some healthy food. 

Usually you go for something healthy, it keeps you refreshed and help you concentrate longer, but the dining spots are far and the food takes more time to wait for. 

You can also try some fast food - it is very close to your library and tastes good, the only thing is, it is a little unhealthy, but at least saves a lot of time.

So, what kind of food do you want to take today?

*choice 
	# I want to have some fast food to save time. Every minute counts!
		You choose some fast food, it saves a precious one hour compared to your normal diet. But you feel a little uneasy because the food is a little oily and dry, so you go to the fountain and have some drink there. You feel much better then. You go back to your seat in the library, and continue going over the pages.

		Uses one hour. Health decreases. 
		*set health -5
		*set time -1
		*goto exercise
	# I still want to have some healthy food. I think I'm not that urgent.
		You ride your bike to the spots where you usually get some good healthy food. It costs more bucks and two hours in total in your day. But it tastes really delicious and comfortable, making you feel more energetic. You feel like you can finish the pages a little faster.

		Uses two hours. Health increases.
		*set health +10
		*set time -2
		*goto exercise

	
*label exercise
*page_break
After reading for an hour or two, you feel kind of distracted. What do you do?

*choice 
	# I want to work to the fullest, since every minute counts.
		You stay in the study room all the time. You're pround of yourself, feeling satisfied, though near the very end, you start to feel tired and lose focus. 
		
		Saves one hour or two. Health decreases. 
		*set health -5
		*set time -0
		*goto checkpoint
	# I want to take some break.
		During the day, you go out for some fresh air several times. It feels good and refreshing, and you feel like you can remain concentrated for longer.
		
		*set health +15

		*set forget false
		*goto stayup
	*else
		You just realize that there's another 40 pages to review! Your professor told about this additional material in the last class!
		
		WTF!
		
		At least you realized it, better than finding it on your test.
		
		Workload increases by 40.

	*goto stayup2
*else
	You feel tired.
	*goto stayup2

*label stayup2

And you are prepared for ${workdone} pages out of ${workload} pages, which means you're around ${percentage} percent confident about the test. 

The unfinished pages you still have some impression on them, at least you attended all classes. Maybe you can rely on your memory, maybe not.

So, do you wish to stay up for the unfinished stuff? 
*choice 
	# I'm concerned about it...let me work for extra two hours to finish. Then I'll sleep.
		You work for extra two hours. You feel tired. 
		
		But at least, you cover some more pages. At least better than some of your stay-up-in-vain.	Nice.
		
		Time increase by two hours. Health decreases.
		*set health -20
		*set time +2
		*set stayedup true
		*goto stayup_result1
	# I think It's more important to sleep well for my important test. Go to sleep now.
		Though you are a little bit nervous and exciting, luckily you have a nice sleep before your important final test.
		
		Health increases.

		*set stayedup false
		*goto final

	*goto stayup_result3

*label stayup_result3
*temp percentage2
*set percentage2 workdone / workload
*set percentage2 * 100
*set percentage2 round(percentage2)
After the additional two hours, you finish ${workdone2} pages more, and now ${workdone} pages out of the overall ${workload} pages, which means you're around ${percentage2} percent confident about the test.

Hope you can score at least that amount.
